#Project 7 - Routing Wires on a Chip
_____________________________________________________________

##Routing.py

In this project, we made a python program that theoretically places a wire on a computer chip.

We designed a breadth first search function that finds a shortest path from one point to another.

It returns the solution of the path and None if there is no solution.

###Times

It took us about 6 hours to write the code and another 4 hours to debug.
